# Appear Offline
### This script will make you appear offline even when you are still on the site.
# Auto Decline Trade
### This script will automatically decline incoming trade requests.  Reload the tab to turn trade requests back on.
# Spam Open Crates
### This script will quickly open crates for you.  You may put in a custom amount of crates you want to buy, or you can just type in `*` to buy the maximum amount of crates you can buy with the amount of atoms you have.  To see what you get, you can look in the console, or just look at your elements section to see what you got.
# Spoof Elements
### This script gives you every single element in the game, each with a different quantity.
