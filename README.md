# Betastar
### Betastar is a game created by only one person using PHP, [Xotic](https://github.com/XOTlC)
## About The Game
#### Betastar is a game that is somewhat similiar to Blooket.  In Blooket, you grind for tokens.  In Betastar you get your daily atoms (the currency for Betastar) with the click of a button.
#### In Betastar, you use your atoms to buy crates that give you elements, like Blooks in Blooket.  The better the element, the higher the sell price for it is.  You can use these elements to show off, or trade for atoms or other elements.
## Chatting
#### A feature that Betastar includes that Blooket does not is the chat.  In the chat, you can talk with people around the globe live.  One thing that is pretty cool about the chat is the sub feature that Xotic has made that gives you atoms if you chat.  Another thing about the chat is that you can start trading with people for recources, or just hang around and have fun.
### Rules for the chat
#### When atom grinding is available, make sure you don't spam the chat.  Admins are almost always watching the chat for spammers and you may be muted or even banned from going on Betastar, so make sure you aren't spamming a lot (unless you're Xotic or an admin because they have all the power XD)
