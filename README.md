# Betastar
Betastar is a game created by only one person using PHP, [Xotic](https://github.com/XOTlC).
## About The Game
Betastar is a game that is somewhat similiar to Blooket.  In Blooket, you grind for tokens.  In Betastar you get your daily atoms with the click of a button.<br>
In Betastar, you use your atoms to buy crates that give you elements, like Blooks in Blooket.  The better the element, the higher the sell price for it is.  You can use these elements to show off.<br>
This game also has the long-awaited Blooket feature: Trading!
## Vocabulary
**Atoms:** game currency<br>
**Elements:** the Betastar version of Blooks
## Chatting
Betastar, adding onto its Discord, has a built-in chat. In the chat, you can talk with people around the globe live.  This chat tends to get pretty funny and is sometimes a little sus. The chat is great for making trades, or just chilling. Make sure you don't spam the chat, even if you're atom grinding.  Admins are almost always watching the chat for spammers. Spam, and you may be muted or even banned from going on Betastar. Only admins can spam, which Xotic sometimes does...
